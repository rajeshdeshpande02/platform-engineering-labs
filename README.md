# Platform Engineering Labs
**Platform Engineering Labs** is my hands-on playground where I experiment with and automate tasks related to Kubernetes Operators, Admission Controllers, and DevOps workflows. 

This monorepo is where I get my hands dirty with building real-world tools to improve operational efficiency, scalability, and security within Kubernetes clusters. By developing these components, I aim to address common challenges in platform engineering—automating repetitive tasks, optimizing workflows, and ensuring smoother deployment pipelines. 

It’s not just about writing code; it’s about creating scalable, repeatable, and reliable systems that drive the core principles of Platform Engineering: automation, integration, and developer experience. Through this, I continuously sharpen my skills while contributing to building the foundational tools that power modern cloud-native platforms.

## Contents
**Kubernetes Operators:** Custom controllers designed to automate various tasks in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

**Automation Scripts:** Scripts to automate infrastructure and platform-related tasks.

**Admission Controllers:** Tools for controlling and modifying Kubernetes API requests before they are persisted.

 ## Operators Overview

| Sr No | Operator Name         | Description                                    | Business Value                            |

| 1     | namespace-ripper      | A Kubernetes operator that deletes namespaces based on a value, with exception support. | Automates cleanup of stale namespaces, reducing manual effort and saving cluster resources. |
| 2     | [Operator Name 2]      | [Description of Operator 2]                                          | [Business Value of Operator 2]                                                |
| 3     | [Operator Name 3]      | [Description of Operator 3]                                          | [Business Value of Operator 3]                                                |
